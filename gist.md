# Regax, a Computer Science for Javascript Tutorial

Hello there! My name is Liben, and I am thrilled you are reading this tutorial explaining the basis of how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does, so let's begin. First, we will understand what regax is and its purpose. Second, we'll look at the different sections that break down each component of the regax as well as explaining each along the way. And third, we'll see what you have learned and compose a series of questions to see if you understand what is needed in regex.

## Summary

What Is a Regex? A regex, which is short for regular expression, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input. For example, the following regular expression can be used to verify that user input is a valid email address:

```md
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
```

Each component of this regex has a unique responsibility to make sure that a user enters an email address that begins with an unspecified number of characters preceding the @ symbol, followed by a domain.
